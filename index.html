        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
<p> 
    I am currently university student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science, combining a strong foundation in analytical thinking with practical computing skills. 
    With a passion for problem-solving, I specialize in leveraging my expertise in mathematics to approach complex challenges in innovative ways, whether through data analysis, algorithm development, or statistical modeling. 
    My studies in computer science have equipped me with a solid understanding of programming, software development, and cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
    As I continue to grow in both fields, I am committed to applying my knowledge to create meaningful solutions that bridge the gap between theory and practice.
